    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sweet bread slices soaked in a milk, dipped in eggs, fried until golden,
      and coated in a sugary cinnamon blend. A crispy and delightful traditional Spanish dessert.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 loaf of day-old bread (baguette works well)</li>
      <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>Olive oil (for frying)</li>
      <li>granulated sugar and ground cinnamon (for dusting)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice the bread into 1-inch thick slices.</li>
      <li>Dip each bread slice into the milk, ensuring it is well-soaked but not falling apart.</li>
      <li>Whisk the eggs and dip each slice of bread into them.</li>
      <li>Fry until golden brown on both sides. Place the fried torrijas on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
      <li>While the torrijas are still warm, roll them in a mixture of sugar and ground cinnamon until coated evenly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Try boiling the milk with cinnamon and lemon for extra flavour, but wait until it cools before using it in the recipe!</p>
